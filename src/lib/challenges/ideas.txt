Switch between two modes
 - Halloween clock
 - Normal clock

 Character enters the scene from a far fog towards the center at 0 in all dimensions

 Overall scene animation to show the right time for each mode, character has no rotating animation so animating the "clock" would look better.

 Character pumpkin head could float around the body and move alognside mouse cursor movements.

 Flip base to shown a happy farm ankou with its head intact and normal pumpkins
